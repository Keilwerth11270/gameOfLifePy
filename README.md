# gameOfLifePy
 Conway's Game of Life written in Python. Used functions in numpy to help store data for each generation and generate new data as generations are formed. Pygame is used for the main window as well as for key inputs. Overall a very fun project and cool to play around with. The edges of the screen are hard borders and the creatures cannot expand beyond it. 

# How to install
 Go to the releases on the right column of the main repository page. It will be under the "About" section. There, click on the release and it will show you several files. Download GameOfLife.exe and run it. Enjoy!

# Controls
 Q = Slow down generations
 W = Speed up generations
 R = Clear screen
 Spacebar = Pause/Play

 By default, pausing will reset the generation speed to it's original speed. If you want it to start off slow, after pausing, press Q several times.
